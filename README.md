**Display customer's available rewards**
As a __customer__, if I am eligible for __rewards__, then I want to see which rewards are available based on my __channel subscriptions__.

The Account Management team has partnered with the Customer Status team that provides a service that checks the customer eligibility based on loyalty and billing status.
